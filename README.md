Disney Trivia

Press the start button, a timer will count down.  Thats how long you have to answer the multiple choice questions. When the timer reaches zero, the results of you score will show up.

This project is pretty tricky.  Really need to considered a lot of things.  I had a hard time figuring out how to add a radio button with the choices of answers the user would have to pick.    

Javascipt and jquery were use to make this project.

To start the quiz just press the start button.
